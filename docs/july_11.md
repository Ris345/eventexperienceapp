- Looked up start guide on sqlite and fastapi setup
- Main investigation
    - Figure out microservice implementation with sqlite using sqlalchemy, fastapi
    - Can microservice architecture be achieved using sqlite in the first place?
    - Comparing my understanding/guides to my fitster project, signals to me that there were was a serious level of abstraction/files that I am unsure about their inclusion/contribution to db performance/operation
- Agenda
    - Start small for now regarding db steps
        - Set up a db solely for user interaction, tokens and then figure out ms interaction at some point and capabilities within sqlite
